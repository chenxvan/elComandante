This example code shows how to create a parser, which is to be loaded
into a main program at runtime. It uses the dlopen() and dlsym()
functions to open a shared object library and load the parser found
therein. Note that the parser has no links to the main program, except
for the loaded symbol name (here it is 'yyparse') and may be compiled
separately without any knowledge of the main.
