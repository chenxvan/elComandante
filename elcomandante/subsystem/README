SUBSCRIPTION SERVER/CLIENT

This client server application allows a multiplexed communication between programms.
A client may provide a named resource to the server, which in turn delivers these
packets to all clients which have subscribed this resource.

Resource naming is arbitrary, although currently CR and LF are mapped to
the string terminator '\0'. Due to the underlaying IP/UDP protocol used, the maximum
namelength plus datalength may not exceed IP MTU limit.

The great flexibility in naming the resources allows for structured naming schemes
to be used, e.g. depending on the experimental setup like "/lx3btpc03/camac/adc"
and "/lx3btpc04/flowbus/gas-pressure". By convention one should not use spaces,
because they will break some scripts.

Clients may identify the server by a default environment variable 'SUBSERVER' or the
compiled in default value "127.0.0.1:12334", if the client does not explicitly
specify an address during execution.

Compatibility with most other measurement programms is acieved by interfacing stdin
and stdout to a resource name with the standard clients. All kinds of line-oriented
ascii data can just be piped to the client and by this provided to the rest of the
system. More complex applications may want to include the sclient.h and packet_t.h
files and send/receive packets directly. The sources of rxclient, txclient and
client can be used as reference for writing own programs.

The "make lib" command will install a libsubsystem.a and the corresponding headers
in the directory specified in the makefile. This library can easily be used by other
programms, without bothering about sub*s source code...
