This code is a complete parser for the subserver 'SlowIO Protocol'.
(except the 'ALL' keyword for channel) The structure was changed to
return from yyparse() call after each command was parsed. The value
argument for 'set' now takes int and float args. 'exit' and 'debug'
commands where added for testing purposes.
