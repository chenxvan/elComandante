Quick Installation Guide
------------------------

1.	Edit the BUILD_OPTIONS, LIBPATH and BINPATH variables in the makefile
	according to your system setup.

2.	Run
		make
	to compile everything. The whole system is usable now.

3.	To use the library from other programs, use
		make install
	This will copy the libsubsystem.a and the include files to the path you
	specified in the makefile (after creating the necessary directories).
	Calling
		make bin
	will copy all binaries to the path you specified in the makefile.

4.	You can find further documentation in the ./documentation directory, but
	if you have Doxygen and Graphviz installed on your system, you might
	want to
		make doc
	You will then find a nice html version pointing your favourite browser
	to the file
		./documentation/html/index.html
