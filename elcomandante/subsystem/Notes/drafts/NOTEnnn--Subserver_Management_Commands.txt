1. Introduction

   This document describes the current implementation of the subservers
   management interface via the Subserver Protocol [1]. The server
   status can be requested and altered by commands sent in management
   type packets.


2.  Management Commands

   Packets send to the server with the type field set to PKT_MANAGEMENT
   (see [1]), will never be forwarded to another client. Instead they
   will be parsed by the server. A response is returned from the server
   only to the requesting client. If the response has multiple lines,
   the server may send a single packet per line, or multiple lines per
   packet.

   The following list of available commands is based on the current
   version of the subserver (as of March 2009).

   In the following sections the syntax description shows optional
   parameters in sqare brackets.

2.1 Help / Command List

   The server sends a list of understood commands in human readable form
   upon reception of the command "help". The following list is shown by
   the time of this writing.

        help            show this help
        setid <name>    set identifier <name> for current client
        lc [-l]         list clients [and their subsciptions]
        la [-l]         list abos [and their suppliers]
        rmc <name>      remove client with id=<name> or addr=<name>
        rma <name>      remove abo with name <name>
        rma unsupplied  remove abos which are not supplied by any client
        [no]log <name>  decrement or increment loglevel of abo <name>
        [no]time <name> set/clear 'add time' flag of abo <name>
        [no]unique <name>   set/clear 'unique supply' flag of abo <name>


2.2 Set Identifier

   Syntax:
	PKT_MANAGEMENT	setid <clientid>

   The clients name shown by the server in any listing (lc or la, see
   below) can be set with this command. A client should pass a
   meaningful name, which can be used to aid in identification of the
   client process. Usualy the command name of the program or script will
   suffice, if it is not a generic program name like "./main" or
   "./a.out".

   Example:
	PKT_MANAGEMENT	setid temperature_control

   This will set the clientid of the current client to "temperature_
   control".


2.3 List Clients

   Syntax:
	PKT_MANAGEMENT  ls [-l]
   or
	PKT_MANAGEMENT  lc [-l]

   To see a list of clients connected to the server use the "lc" or
   "ls" command, which is an alias for "lc". Without any parameter the
   response of the server might look like the following (Note: All
   IPs have been obscured):

   Example:
	3 clients:
	manager                 134.61.xxx.xxx:60895     0   1 +0
	client                  134.61.xxx.xxx:38455     0   1 +1739453
	thpc                    134.61.xxx.xxx:17100     1   0 +9

   The lines are a whitespace separated list, wherein the kind of
   whitespace, any number of tabs or space, may vary.

	<clientid> <sourceip>:<sourceport> <#subm> <#subsc> +<lastrx>

   The <clientid> field shows the name set by the client with the "setid"
   command as described above. The <sourceip>:<sourceport> show the IP
   connection to the client. The following fileds show the numbers of
   supplied and subscribed abos of the client and the time in seconds
   since the server last received a packet from this client <lastrx>.

   The <clientid> field of a client might change while the client is
   active, if the client issues a "setid" command. More than one client
   may have the same name, but the <sourceip>:<sourceport> field will
   always be unique among all clients at a given time.

   The <lastrx> field may not be meaningful, if the client does not
   supply any abo, or if the client has not jet sent a packet. In this
   case the server may substitute the time by the string "unsupplied".

   A more detailed listing can be seen when giving the parameter "-l",
   the server will then also list the names of the supplied and
   subscribed abos for each client.

   Example:
	4 clients:
	manager                 134.61.xxx.xxx:60895      0   1 +0
	     subscribed /manage
	client                  134.61.xxx.xxx:1027      1   1 +16
	     supplies   /system/ntp_stati
	     subscribed /system/ntp_stati
	client                  134.61.xxx.xxx:38455     0   1 +1739139
	     subscribed /equip/mvme/temperature
	thpc                    134.61.xxx.xxx:17100     1   0 +3
	     supplies   /thpc/data


2.4 List Abos

   Syntax:
	PKT_MANAGEMENT	la [-l]

   A complete list of available abos can be requested with the "la"
   command. The server will respond with multiple lines of the format

	<flags> <aboname> <#suppliers> <#subscriptions> +<lastrx>

   If no flags are set for an abo the <flags> field will just be "---".
   Any flag set will change one of the '-' to a letter indicating the
   kind of flag
	l--	logged by the server
	-t-	a timestamp is prepended by the server
	--u	the server permitts only one supplier ("unique" flag)
   or any combinations of these ("lt-" = logged, timestamped, not
   unique). All flags are case sensitive. The number, order and kind of
   flags may change and will be documented in the subservers
   documentation.

   The <aboname> can be any string not containing the "\0" escape
   character according to the Subserver Protocol [1], nevertheless all
   users are strongly encouraged not to use whitespace in their
   abonames, as it will make this output hard to parse. Programs do not
   need to be able to parse whitespace containing abonames.

   The number of suppliers and subscriptions for the specified abo and
   the time since the last packet for this abo has been received, are
   given in the remaining fields.
   
   Example:
	9 current submissions:
	l-- /thpc/data                       3   1 +3
	l-- /system/ntp_stati                5   5 +12
	--- /equip/vx1720/diode_info         7   0 +1725997
	--- /manage                          0   1 +1634067
	--- /equip/mvme/temperature          1   2 +7
	--- /control                         0   0 +677100
	--- /system/ntp_status               0   0 unsupplied
	--- /equip/HV/status                 0   1 unsupplied
	--- /equip/diode/status              0   1 unsupplied

   Analog to the "-l" parameter for the "ls" command described above,
   this command will also give a more detailed listing giving the "-l"
   parameter. Following truncated output should clarify the structure:

   Example:
	9 current submissions:
	l-- /thpc/data                       1   1 +7
	     supplied by   thpc                    (134.61.xx.xxx:17100)
	     subscribed by client                  (134.61.xx.xxx:55298)
	--- /equip/vx1720/diode_info         0   0 +1735495
	--- /manage                          0   1 +1643565
	     subscribed by manager                 (134.61.xx.xxx:60895)
	--- /equip/mvme/temperature          1   2 +1
	     supplied by   client                  (134.61.xx.xxx:32770)
	     subscribed by client                  (134.61.xx.xxx:38455)
	     subscribed by client                  (134.61.xx.xxx:32770)
	--- /control                         0   0 +686598
	--- /system/ntp_status               0   0 unsupplied
	

   NOTE: As you can see in the above example, a more meaningful name for
         the clients would be very helpful to distinguish between the
         different functions provided by the clients.


2.5 Remove Clients

   Syntax:
	rmc <which>

   The use of this command should not be necessary in normal operation.

   Clients can be removed from the servers list of clients with the
   "rmc" command. The server will then unsubscribe all abos for the
   client, unregister any supplies and remove the client without any
   notification of the client. This is helpful if a client program
   terminated without sending a PKT_CLIENTTERM type packet. Using this
   command with an active client as a parameter will cause the server
   to stop sending any packets to it, effectively making the client
   useless. A packet recieved from the removed client will then register
   a new connection to the server without any subscriptions.

   The <which> parameter is matched against the clientid and ip:port
   fields of the client list and all matching clients are removed.


2.6 Remove Abos

   Syntax:
	rma <which>
   or   rma unsupplied

   The use of this command should not be necessary in normal operation.

   The <which> parameter is matched against the aboname fields of the
   servers internal abo list and all matching abos are removed. The
   special keyword "unsupplied" will remove any abos with zero
   registered suppliers. Any clients with a subscription of the deleted
   abos will be unsubscribed without any notification. This will make
   all these clients effectively useless.


2.7 Abo Flags (log, time, unique)

   Syntax:
	time <aboname>
	notime <aboname>
	log <aboname>
	nolog <aboname>
	unique <aboname>
	nounique <aboname>

   These commands set or clear the respective flag for the given abo. As
   described in Section 'List Abos' above, the number and kind of flags
   supported by the server may change.
