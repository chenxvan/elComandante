1. Introduction

   This protocol specifies a partially binary data transfer protocol
   aimed to be used with high data rate applications, such as FADC
   readout or multi event TDC or QDC packets.
   
   The basis of this protocol is the Subserver Protocol [1], which
   will be used to submit lines of ASCII text. 


2. Packet Layout
   
   FIXME: define abo-names?


2.1 QDC/TDC Control Packets

   Following command structure is used to control data readout of
   TDC/QDC device processes. Strings are usually lower case, but the
   protocol may be implemented case insensitive by the device process.


2.1.1 Device Setup Commands

   To setup the device for the measurement, these commands may be
   used. After a 

   Type: PKT_SETDATA
   Data: enable <feature>
   Data: disable <feature>

   <feature>
   	'single-shot'
	take a single event only 
	'zero-suppression'

   Type: PKT_SETDATA
   Data: enable channel <n>
   Data: disable channel <n>


   Type: PKT_SETDATA
   Data: reset


2.1.2 Run Control Commands

   These commands start or stop the actual data taking.

   Type: PKT_SETDATA
   Data: start
   Data: stop

   The 'start' command enables data taking of the device. Unless this
   command has been given, there shall be no data stored in device
   buffers, or the buffers must be cleared on reception. The device
   process shall not send data to the subsystem taken by the device
   prior reception of this command. The 'start' command may -- for
   this reason -- results in multiple commands being sent to the
   device (e.g. clear buffer and start run) and thus is not to be used
   for timing the start of data taking if event synchronisation is
   critical; use hardware inhibits for this.

   If a 'stop' command is received the device process must stop to
   send further data as soon as possible. This command may be received
   asynchronously. It is unspecified if this command causes the
   underlaying hardware to stop taking data.


   Type: PKT_SETDATA
   Data: set <option> <parameter>

   The following options may be implemented:
   <option>
	'nevents' <n>
	Set the number of events to take.

	'run' <n>
	Set the next run number


   Additional Commands

   Type: PKT_SETDATA
   Data: clear buffer

   FIXME: more generic needed?


2.2 QDC/TDC Event Data Packets

   These packets are sent by the QDC/TDC device process to transmit
   event data to the subsystem. Each line represents data from one
   event and is terminated by a newline character. Multiple lines may
   be sent in a single packet.

   Type: PKT_DATA
   Data: <timestamp> <run> <eventnumber> <n> <LISTOFDECIMALS> '\n'

   timestamp
   	unix timestamp, seconds since epoche

   run
   	The run number in decimal representation without leading
	zeros. If run numbers are not used, zero '0'

   eventnumber
	Number from the event data read from the device data
	(integer). if there is additional integer data (e.g. a trigger
	word), this data may be added as the fractional part.

   <n>	Number of entries in the following list. (decimal
	representation). This number may be zero, if the list is empty
	(e.g. as result of zero suppression)

   <LISTOFDECIMALS>
	The data is transmitted as a single space separated list of
	numbers in decimal notation. Numbers may be integers or simple
	floats. It is left to the implementation of the device
	process, if this is just ADC readout values or transformed
	data with a known unit (e.g. coulomb for QDC, nanoseconds for
	TDC,... )

	FIXME: need channel number? like 4:3.2, or placeholder '0'?
