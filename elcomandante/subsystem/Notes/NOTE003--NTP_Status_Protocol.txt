1. Introduction

   The protocol described in this document is intended to be used for
   monitoring the status of Network Time Protocol [1] servers to assure
   correct time among the hosts comprising the subsystem network. It is
   based on the Subserver Protocol [2] to send data messages.
   

2. Packet Format

   The monitoring program should send packets according to the format
   described below. A reasonable interval is not less than once a
   minute, because usually ntp status rarely changes. A more
   convenient solution might be to check the stratum at a higher rate
   and only report changes. It should nevertheless be assured to send
   a packet at least approximately every ten minutes to distinguish
   between a constant stratum and a failing monitor process.

   Type: PKT_DATA
   Data: <timestamp> <hostname> <stratum> [svr=<server>] [acc=<acc>ms]

	<timestamp>
		Unix timestamp of the host sending the packet.

	<hostname>
		An Identifyer for the host machine being monitored. It
		should be the name given by the 'hostname' command, or
		the the first part of it.

	<stratum>
		The synchronisation level (stratum) of the ntp server
		on the host machine. Depending on implementation this
		can be requested with something like
		# ntpdc -c sysinfo
		or 
		# ntpstat
		If the stratum is indeterminant this field should
		contain the string "N/A".

	<server>
		[optional] The name or IP of the server the host is
		synchronised to.
		
	<acc>
		[optional] The expected accuracy of the host time.

   Different hosts in a given network MAY provide the a different set
   of arguments, although it might be usefull to have all senders
   write their packets in the same format.

   The following examples show different valid combinations of the
   possible arguments. Each line shows the PKT_DATA data part.

	1236166991 host1 3
	1236166992 host2 N/A
	1236166997 host3 3 svr=134.130.4.17
	1236166999 host4 3 acc=56ms
	1236167021 host5 3 svr=134.130.4.17 acc=56ms

   With the hostname given in each packet, it is possible to have all
   hosts sending the packets to the same abo. This joins all data into
   a single stream, which reduces abo count and is more managable.
   A suggestion for this abo name could be "/system/ntpd_stati".
